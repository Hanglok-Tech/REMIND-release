1. Configure parameters:
   1.1 Open the "ConfigEdit.exe" tool in the directory "deploy_64\linux_64(windows_64)".
   1.2 Configure the parameters according to the instructions in "document\topology_editor.txt" for two nodes.
   1.3 Configure the two node IDs as 1001 and 1002, and you can automatically name them.
   1.4 Configure the IP address to the IP of the IBCCM Docker service installed.

2. Example tool demonstration:
   We will demonstrate configuring two nodes (one running on a Windows system and one running on a Linux system); assuming the node running on the Windows system has an ID of 1001, and the one running on the Linux system has an ID of 1002
   
   Before running, we need to ensure that the relevant services have been installed according to the file 'IBCCM_installation.txt'.
   
   2.1 Running the Windows system node:
      Step 1: Copy the "Remindmidleware-release\example\remind_test\windows_deploy_64" to the directory of the Windows system.
      Step 2: Copy the previously configured config files (device_config.xml, topology_config.xml) to the "config" folder in this directory.
      Step 3: Open the "remind_test.exe" program to launch the interface.
      Step 4: In the opened program interface, select "1001" as the origin ID and "1002" as the target ID.
      Step 5: Click "start" to run.
   2.2 Running the Linux system node:
      Step 1: Copy the "Remindmidleware-release\example\remind_test\linux_deploy_64" to the directory of the Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04).
      Step 2: Copy the previously configured config files (device_config.xml, topology_config.xml) to the "config" folder in this directory.
      Step 3: Open the "remind_test.sh" script program to launch the interface.
      Step 4: In the opened program interface, select "1002" as the origin ID and "1001" as the target ID.
      Step 5: Click "start" to run.
   2.3 This way, we can observe that the two nodes running on Windows and Linux systems can communicate with each other.
