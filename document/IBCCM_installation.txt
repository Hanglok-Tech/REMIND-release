1. Install Docker on the server, supporting both Windows and Linux systems. For testing purposes, the Linux system installed is Ubuntu 22.04, and the Windows system is Windows 11.
2. Within the Docker system that has been installed, install the service environment images:
   Extract the downloaded image installation script `remind-win-linux.tar` to a directory, install the relevant services, and execute the following scripts in the extracted directory:
   For Linux: `init-service-linux.sh`
   For Windows: `init-service-win.bat`
   This way, the scripts will automatically install the services.
   Note: Ensure that the system is connected to the internet while executing the scripts.
